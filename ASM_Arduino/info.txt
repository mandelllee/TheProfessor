ESP32 has five strapping pins:
• MTDI(GPIO12)		Pull-down
• GPIO0				Pull-up
• GPIO2				Pull-down
• MTDO(GPIO15)		Pull-up
• GPIO5				Pull-down

Consequently, if a strapping pin is unconnected or the connected 
external circuit is high-impendence, the internal weak pull-up/pull-down will
determine the default input level of the strapping pins.
After reset, the strapping pins work as the normal-function pins.



Hardware changes
================
GPIO25 connected to SD card's CD pin through 330 Om resistor

DHT22
======
Used libraries: 
	SimpleDHT sensors library
	
DS18B20
=======
Sensors are connected to J10 port.
Currently there is 5k6 pull-up resistor for data line. 4k7 resistor is recommended.
Used libraries:
	Arduino-Temperature-Control-Library
	OneWire 2.3 or newer (library included in arduino 1.7.8 does not support ESP32)
	
HX711
======
Connect sensor to U6 for using with example sketch
Used libraries:
	HX711
	
ISL29125
========
Board has it's own I2C pull up resistors. These could be disabled by cutting traces on the board
Used libraries:
	ISL29125_Breakout_Arduino_Library-master_modified
		Wire.begin() was removed from RGB_sensor.init() function. This prevents using default I2C port on pins 20, 21.
		
TSL2561
=======
Board has it's own I2C pull up resistors.
Used libraries:
	TSL2561-Arduino-Library-master-modified
		Wire.begin() was removed from begin() function. This prevents using default I2C port on pins 20, 21.
		
SD card
=======
Hardware changes: GPIO25 connected to SD card's CD pin through 330 Om resistor
Used libraries
	ESP32 SD (modified). Do not use SD_MMC - this library is not for SPI mode.
		remove spi.begin() from SD.cpp -> SDFS::begin(). This prevents using default SPI port.
		SD.cpp location: ....\arduino-1.7.8\hardware\espressif\arduino-esp32\libraries\SD\src\SD.cpp
